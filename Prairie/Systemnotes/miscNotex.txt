Our system has imaging galvo mirrors that are 6mm in size. This is an
upgrade over the standard 3mm size since the drive has to work harder
to move the larger mirror which has more inertia. At the moment the
larger mirror doesn't convey an advantage but if we add an lens
upstream to make the beam larger then we will be able to use a higher
NA objective and still capture the whole beam. A higher NA will
increase resolution by decreasing the point-spread function.

You must have the correct dichroic in the scanhead for the uncaging
laser to give optimal results. 



The DIC filter above the objectives is polarized and will decrease the
intensity of the laser(s). I don't remember if Long said it was both
or just one laser.
