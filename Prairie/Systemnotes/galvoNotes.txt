If you're not sure that that Galvos are working then you
can check the galvos by running the NI test&meaurement on the
appropriate board and DAC out. Feed in an amplitude of about 0.75V and
3Hz and see if the mirror moves. 

In the test suite a value of 1000 is 1 Hz. 

The amplitude is 1/2 peak not peak-to-peak (which is double the number
you type in).
