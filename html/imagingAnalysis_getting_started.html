%% Introduction
% These routines will import and analyse 2-photon data derived from
% various imaging platforms. Most functions for importing and creating
% the data structure assume a Prairie system. These can easily be
% modified for other systems and examples of such code is included for
% ScanImage and Fluoview. 
%
% Functions are grouped into logically named sub-directories according
% to their purpose. It is worth trawling through the folders to see
% what's in there: all functions have extensive help but not all
% are described in the HTML help docs due to time contstraints. 
%
% This toolbox is constantly being updated with bug fixes, performance
% improvements, and new features. If you need to modify code, you
% are encouraged to write a wrapper around existing functions and
% store your wrappers in a separate location. This way you'll
% benefit from future releases automatically without having to
% continually port your code. Where possible, we take care that new
% features don't break old code.
